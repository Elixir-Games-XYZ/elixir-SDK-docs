# Reference

### GetUserData() <a href="#user-content-getuserdata" id="user-content-getuserdata"></a>

This endpoint retrieves OpenId information of users. It validates the JWT generated by the SDK and provides the following Elixir-specific data:

* ElixirID: A unique, unchangeable identifier within the Elixir Platform
* Username: The user's Elixir nickname, displayable in-game
* Wallet: The user's wallet linked to the game's blockchain network

{% hint style="warning" %}
For games with existing User entities and account credentials, it's advised to add a "Link Account" feature. This pairs the ElixirID with your User Entity, requiring a one-time setup, enabling users to use their native game accounts when accessing through Elixir.
{% endhint %}

### GetCollections() <a href="#user-content-getcollections" id="user-content-getcollections"></a>

Use this endpoint to access NFT collections specified in the Elixir Dashboard. It serves as NFT gating, allowing retrieval of all NFTs owned by the user in these collections.

### GetTournaments() <a href="#user-content-gettournaments" id="user-content-gettournaments"></a>

Integrating this SDK provides a comprehensive tournament tool. This method enables the game client to access all Elixir tournaments available for the game. Coordination between the game backend and Elixir configuration is necessary.&#x20;

Refer to the [tournaments-api](../../api-docs/api-docs-1/tournaments-api/ "mention") documentation for more information.
