The SDK ensures that the game runs within the Elixir Launcher Environment. Upon successful verification, it retrieves user session credentials, enabling login through the Elixir Launcher account.&#x20;

Failure in this verification prevents game execution, blocking access outside the Elixir Launcher and for banned users.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
The latest SDK version allows owners to bypass this check, permitting execution outside the Elixir Launcher Environment.
