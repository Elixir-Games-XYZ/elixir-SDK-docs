# üèÅ Kick-off

## Click and play

Integrate Elixir inside your game for a smoother user experience: We believe that having a fragmented ecosystem with individual login forms creates a significant barrier for user onboarding that must be knocked down.

By integrating with Elixir Services, new players should be able to **click and play** your game: Our Auth Services provide user authentication and complement it with some of the Elixir features that grant easy-to-implement add-ons for your game.

## Elixir Gamer Services

Merge web3 infrastructure with gaming by taking advantage of the Elixir Gamer Services:

* [**Access E**](../api-docs/api-docs-1/user.md)[**lixir profile**](../api-docs/api-docs-1/user.md)**.** Get the Elixir user profile; access his wallet, username and profile picture to display it in your game
* [**NFT Gating**](../api-docs/api-docs-1/nfts.md): Web3 is made simple. Import user NFTs inside your game and convert them to Skins, from native collections to cross-IP in any chain.
* [**Elixir Tournaments**](../dashboard/tools/tournaments/)**:** Host Elixir tournaments inside your game, making it social and competitive.

### Elixir Gaming Services SDKs

Download the latest version of our SDKs, available for **Unity** and **Unreal** engines, for easy integration with Elixir or relate to the API documentation.
