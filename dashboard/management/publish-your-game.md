  Uploading a game on the Elixir Platform is extremely easy. Let's get you
  onboarded.

# ðŸ‘¾ General

### 1. Register in Elixir&#x20;

Let's start by creating an account on the Elixir Publisher platform before uploading to the game. Registering on Elixir is quite simple. Go to the [launcher.elixir.app](https://launcher.elixir.app) and fill in your details.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Once you have created an account, **contact our team** to give you access to the Publisher Dashboard.
{% endhint %}

### 2. View your games ðŸŽ®

{% hint style="info" %}
Please be aware that we are currently working in a UX/UI refactor in order to simplify this process
{% endhint %}

Once you are logged on to the Elixir Publisher platform, you can navigate to the `Games` tab in the navigation bar from the left side of the screen. From there, you can manage all your existing games and create new ones!

### 3. Create a New Game

In some cases, the Elixir Games team may already have created the game for you. If this is the case, you can skip this point and go to point 4: "Edit a Game". If this is not your case, or you want to create a new game from scratch, click the **Create** game button and enter the following:

* **Name**: The Game name must be unique in the Elixir Games Platform. Please introduce the Game name and how you want it to be displayed on the platform. Avoid using non-alphanumeric characters
* **Blockchain**: If your game uses a different Blockchain from the ones available, please select a similar or Layer 1 blockchain and contact the Elixir Games support team. Then we will be happy to add this blockchain to the platform. You can edit this field in the future _(if not, don't hesitate to get in touch with support)_

### 4. Set up

Once you have created a game, you will now be able to modify the contents. You must be aware that,

* The editing process can be done in different stages: You can save the status of what you edited and continue with it later.
* If your organization is sharing the publisher account with many members, avoid making changes simultaneously, as it may lead to overlapping errors and loss of information.
* Once you are done with your game edit, you can proceed with point 5: "Submit your Game".

We have separated the game information into different sections:

#### General

Here you will be able to modify the game information. We recommend following the [Monstropoly](https://launcher.elixir.app/games/monstropoly) Game Page reference. This information will be displayed on the Launcher Game page as follows:

* **Name**: Will be displayed in caps. Avoid entering long game names
* **Headline**: Short description + call to action of the game
* **Game Info**: All relevant game information for the customers
* **Description**: All information about what players should expect about your game: Lore, Game Modes, Personalization, Interaction with NFTs, Tokens...

#### Media

The Media section allows publishers to upload all the content that will be displayed in the Game Page:

* **Game Card:** Game card image. Resolution: 512 x 576 px.
* **Background Cover:** Used as the background for your game. This image will be visible in the Game page. If no image is uploaded, the fallback will be the first Carousel image. Resolution 1920 x 1080 px
* **Images**: Used to showcase your game. These images will be visible on the Game page: Visual Arts + Gameplay pictures. Resolution: 1920x1080 px
* **Logo**: Used as the logo for your game. This image will be visible on the Game page. Resolution 256 x 356 px
* **Videos**: Video trailer of the Game. Resolution: 1920 x 1080 px (mp4 or webm)
* **Publisher Icon**: Company Logo. Resolution: 256 x356 px. _(Removed temporarily due to refactor duties)_

Here you can see the relations between the published media containers and the Launcher's Game Page:

#### Language & Social

Here you can provide more information about the Game languages supported. And also here is the place where you can add the social media links of your game.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please be aware that we have removed the Facebook reference. This should be fixed for the next version. We apologize for the inconvenience.
{% endhint %}

![Your social links will be displayed in the Game Page as in the Image.](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-08-15 at 16.58.18.png>)

#### Specifications

Here you will be able to provide useful information about the technical requirements that your game requires to be run on a PC. In case that you don't see the computer specifications that your game requires, please contact support and we will add it as soon as we can.
