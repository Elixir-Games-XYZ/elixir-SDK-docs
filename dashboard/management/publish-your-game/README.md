# ðŸ‘¾ Add a new Game

### 1. Register as a Publisher&#x20;

Let's start by creating an account on the Elixir Publisher platform before uploading to the game. Registering on Elixir is quite simple. Go to the [launcher.elixir.app](https://launcher.elixir.app) and fill in your details.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Once you have created an account, **contact our team** to give you access to the **Publisher** Dashboard.
{% endhint %}

### 2. Create a New Game

To harness the full potential of our innovative game launcher, your journey begins with the [creation of a game](create-a-game.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
_Sometimes, the Elixir Games team may already have created the game for you in advance. If this is your case, you can skip this point and go to point 3: "Edit a Game"._
{% endhint %}

### 4. Set up

Once you have created a game, you will now be able to [modify the contents](../../tournaments/set-up.md). You must be aware that,

* The editing process can be done in different stages: You can save the status of what you edited and continue with it later.
* If your organization is sharing the publisher account with many members, avoid making changes simultaneously, as it may lead to overlapping errors and loss of information.
* Once you are done with your game edit, you can proceed with point 5: "Submit your Game".
* Then a Platform manager will review the content and evaluate if it [qualifies for approval](../../in-app-purchases/review-guidelines.md).

We have separated the game information into different sections:
