# Handle branches

#### Master Branch

The Master Branch is used for public release. Once a new version of the game has been approved and a new release is on the way. Users must create a new build on Master and upload there the Game Build in a new Depot.

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend to upload the Game Build to the TEST branch first in order to check that everything is running correctly before making it public.
{% endhint %}

#### Test Branch

This branch is used for closed beta access using [Beta Codes](../../beta-codes/). Publishers can upload every new version of the game to test it internally or with the community before making it public.

This branch is also used for the pre-alpha versions when a game is not released yet.

#### Develop Branch&#x20;

Upload your build for internal testing. Check out the SDK integration and make the last adjustments before releasing the game with your audience.&#x20;

Only whitelisted developer accounts will have access to this build.
