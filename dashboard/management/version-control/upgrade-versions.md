# Upgrade Versions

Every new **Build** represents a new version of the Game. So every time that a publisher wants to release a new version of the game, it is needed to create a new build, and then activate it. \
\
When users launch Elixir, it will detect a new version is available and will prompt users to download the update before playing.
