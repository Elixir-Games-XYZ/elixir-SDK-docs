## Create Beta Codes

Let's get started by generating a few fresh beta codes so you can distribute to your community. There a few fields to complete to get started:

* **Label**: The collection name for this batch of beta codes. Add a name you feel familiar with to remember it.
* **Number of codes**: How many different beta codes belonging to this collection.
* **Number of uses por code**: How many times a code can be activated by a user.
* **Custom Name**: Add your own name for the code(s). Leave it empty to the code(s) are generated code keys random.
* **Temporary Access**: Enable it to add an expiry date to create a temporary access pass for your users.&#x20;
