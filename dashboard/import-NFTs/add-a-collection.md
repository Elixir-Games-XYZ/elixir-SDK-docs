# Add a Collection

## Import NFT Collections

{% hint style="success" %}
### We support collections listed on Opensea, MagicEden and Rarible

With support for Solana, Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, ImmutableX... And more coming on board very often!
{% endhint %}

Import collections from any of the supported marketplaces is as simple as pasting the collection URL from that specific marketplace, selecting the appropriate blockchain if necessary and defining what **use** you intend.

* **Cross-IP:** Switch on this if the imported collection is not your original artwork.
* **Coming Soon**: Switch on this if the imported collections are not already playable in the game.
* **NFT Access**: NFTs from this collection provide owners with immediate, private access to your game without the use of [beta codes](../beta-codes/).&#x20;
