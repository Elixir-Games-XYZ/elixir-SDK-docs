1. **Fee Sponsorship**: The Gas Manager is responsible for fee sponsorship. It is the designated entity that covers the transaction fees incurred by users when they interact with the crypto in-app purchases.
2. **Enhanced User Engagement**: By sponsoring gas fees, the Gas Manager removes a significant barrier for users. Gamers can seamlessly participate in in-game activities and transactions without the need to concern themselves with the costs associated with blockchain interactions.
