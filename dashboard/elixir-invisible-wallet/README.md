## What is the Elixir Invisible Wallet

Within the Elixir ecosystem, users have the opportunity to establish their own crypto wallet. This wallet stands as a non-custodial solution, ensuring that users maintain complete control over their cryptocurrency funds. What sets these wallets apart is their integration with the Account Abstraction protocol ([ERC-4337](https://www.erc4337.io/docs)), a groundbreaking feature that simplifies user interactions across the entire platform.

1. **Non-Custodial Control**: Your crypto wallet is designed to be non-custodial, which means users have exclusive control over their funds. They possess the private keys, granting them ownership and authority over their cryptocurrency assets.
2. **Seamless Platform Integration**: One of the most innovative aspects of these wallets is their seamless integration across the entire platform. Users don't need to undertake any specific actions to interact with their wallet. It operates effortlessly, much like using a credit card for transactions.
3. **Account Abstraction Protocol (ERC-4337)**:  This means that when users engage in in-game purchases or perform actions that involve blockchain transactions, the game owners can cover the associated fees. This approach encourages gamers to make more in-game purchases and interact more deeply with your gaming ecosystem.

This user-friendly approach empowers users to participate fully in your gaming ecosystem, much like how they utilize a credit card for everyday transactions.
