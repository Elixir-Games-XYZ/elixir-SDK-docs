   * Games specify the stat(s) that users must progress to complete the quest.
   * Stats serve as quantitative measures of user activity or accomplishments within the game, such as kills, collectibles found, distance traveled, etc.
2. **Title:**
   * Each quest is accompanied by a catchy and descriptive title that captures the essence of the challenge and encourages user participation.
   * Titles should be engaging and evoke curiosity or excitement to motivate users to undertake the quest.
3. **Description:**
   * Quests include a clear and concise description outlining the objectives and requirements for completion.
   * Descriptions provide users with guidance on what they need to do to progress through the quest and earn rewards.
4. **Image:**
   * Games provide an image to accompany each quest, enhancing visual appeal and recognition.
   * Images are displayed on the game quest card within the platform's interface, using a resolution of 500px x 250px for optimal display quality.
